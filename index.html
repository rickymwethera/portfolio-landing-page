        <h4>My First Webpage</h4>
        <p>This was one of the first projects i did and it is a compilation of afew webpages that i made during my practising in moringa school.

        <h4>Media Query Practice</h4>
        <p>I did this project as I was learning about the Responsive design and  media that can be used in the creation of websites to show different and fitting views of the website depending on the device being used to view it. i.e A phone has different screen size than a laptop 
          and this helps configure the website.</p>
        <p>This project contains a webpage with the lorem ipsum text and i used it CSS to add the different media configurations.</p>
        <p>For this project I used the HTML language and CSS for its styling.</p>
